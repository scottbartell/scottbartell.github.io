Hi, I'm [Scott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottsbartell/).
 
I'm a full stack software engineer / consultant with over 7 years of professional experience.

I believe in collaborative organizational cultures deeply rooted in guidance and feedback.

I believe that business value should be aligned with software development and that 
testing, feedback, continuous improvement, small batch sizes, cross-functional teams, and ruthless prioritization 
are some of the most effective ways to deliver that value.

I have a wide range of technical experience but I am most familiar with developing and scaling 
Ruby on Rails applications with Postgres hosted on Heroku.
