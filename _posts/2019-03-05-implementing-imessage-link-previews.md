## Default iMessage Links
Out of the box when you share a link on iMessage it looks like this:

![iMessage link preview without image][link-preview-without-image]

That's pretty boring; it doesn't provide me with any useful information about the content of the page and doesn't make me want to click on it.
 
We can do better.

## Enabling iMessage Link Previews
It turns out we can make the link more compelling by adding some [Open Graph metadata][open-graph] to the page.

If we add the `og:title` and `og:image` Open Graph meta tags to the page like this:

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="iPhone" />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/image.png" />
```

The shared link will now have a custom title and image, and look like this:

![iMessage link preview with an image][link-preview-with-image]

Awesome!

## Implementing Link Previews on Push of Love

Now let's apply this to Push of Love! 

First lets see what we are starting with:

![PushOfLove.com iMessage link preview with heading and logo][push-of-love-link-preview]

Interesting! We already have a title and a logo. 

It turns out, if iMessage is unable to find an `og:title` it looks for the `<title>` tag on the page. In addition, if iMessage is unable to find a `og:image` it looks for a logo and in this case it found our [apple-touch-icon.png][apple-touch-icon] on the page.

Let's specify an `og:image` in the `<head>` of the page:

```html
<meta property="og:image" content="https://pushoflove.com/icon.png" />
```

![PushOfLove.com iMessage link preview with heading and image][push-of-love-link-preview-image]

Nice, now we can see a large image of our logo when the link is shared!

This is great for the homepage of Push of Love, but what about the pages for individual pushes?

ðŸ’¡ Idea! What if each "push" has it's own image that demonstrates how it would look on your phone?!

That's a great idea... but we create new content for Push of Love every day and we really don't want to spend all our time creating new images in Photoshop... 

*So, can we automate it?*

**Hell yes we can.**

*Stay tuned for the next post on how.*
